# object-detection

#### I have used pretrained model resnet v2 for the object detection here.
Image Classification is also done and technologies like CNN, Tensorflow, Python, Transfer Learning are used. 
Given a structured folder with images, modeled a neural network to classify any type of images using Transfer Learning by training and fine tuning ResNet and VGGNet. Tested with Animals, Foods and Cars with a success range of 50%-90%.

Create a database folder of images of your choice, and give input path to the model, input the model components using google colab or Jypter notebook, as the model is already trained on million images of imagenet and the results are divided in 1000 categories like pen, pencil, clothes, cars, animals, food, etc. 
You will get results in the square box of differnet detecting the objects.
